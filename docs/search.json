Thanks for visiting my website.\nI am a PhD student at Dept. of Economics, Stockholm University, Sweden\nMy main interest revolves around political economy, growth and labor.\nMy ongoing research investigates how political incentives can create distortions in the bureaucracy in India; a second project looks into the effect of income inequality on police performance in USA. Another project tries to measure the effect of relieving hiring frictions on small and medium manufacturing firms in India. You can read more about them under the research tab.\n\nYou can also see my CV  here."

    "text": "Work in progress\n\nPolitical overreach, state capacity and firm dynamics\nPolitical overreach into bureaucracy is a routine occurrence in India. How does this affect bureaucrat’s ability and effectiveness? I investigate the effects of political overreach on local state capacity as well as on firm behaviour. Using the universe of bureaucratic postings and transfers and biographical data on state level politicians, I empirically document that politician’s characteristics are associated with unusual transfer patterns. Using an Instrumental Variable that captures the shock to politicians willingness to overreach, I estimate the effect of political overreach on firm’s entry and investment behaviour. The goal with this project is to generate quantitative evidence of growth effects of distortions arising out of political frictions.\n\n\nMonopsony in informal labor market\n(with Simoni Jain, University of California Berkeley)\nWe investigate a unique feature of the informal labor markets in India where, due to regulatory costs, most small firms hire workers through a third party subcontractor. A priori the subcontractors can potentially reduce the hiring search friction. However, as hiring costs for subcontractors tend to be convex in these settings, providing them enough incentives would be increasing hard for firms specially at an early stage of growth. In other words, firms are prone to be held up by subcontractor’s lack of incentive even when it may be optimal for them to hire more. We experimentally vary support to subcontractors to manipulate their hiring cost and investigate its effect on both offered wages and firm productivity. In this project, our aim is to shed light on frictions experienced by small firms and their effect on the growth trajectory.\n\n\nPolice funding inequality and police performance in US\n(with Mitch Downey, IIES, Stockholm University)\nPolice departments in USA draw majority of their funding from revenues generated by local governments. This means that funding for local police can be unequal within a metropolitan area among neighbouring cities. What are the consequences of this arrangement for the allocation of police officers, the quality of police representation in majority-minority communities, and aggregate crime and officer-involved violence? Using a shift share instrument, we estimate the effects of increasing income inequality in MSA’s with high-levels of fiscal fragmentation (i.e., instances where the population is divided across many different legally and fiscally independent cities), both relative to increasing inequality when fragmentation is low, and relative to highly fragmented MSA’s that do not see increasing inequality.\n\n\n\nPublications\nPullabhotla, Hemant K., Mustafa Zahid, Sam Heft-Neal, Vaibhav Rathi, and Marshall Burke. “Global biomass fires and infant mortality.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 120, no. 23 (2023): e2218210120."

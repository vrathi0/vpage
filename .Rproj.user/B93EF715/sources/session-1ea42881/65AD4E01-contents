::: {#hero-heading}

Hi! Thanks for visiting my website. 

I am a PhD student at Dept. of Economics, Stockholm University, Sweden

My main interest revolves around political economy, growth and labor. 

My ongoing research investigates how political incentives can create distortions in the bureaucracy in India; a second project looks into the effect of income inequality on police performance in USA. Another project tries to measure the effect of relieving hiring frictions on small and medium manufacturing firms in India. You can read more about them under the research tab. 

<p>You can also see my CV <a href="file/Vaibhav_CV_Jan2024.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>.</p>
